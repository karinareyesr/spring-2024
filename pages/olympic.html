<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p> The Olympic Mountains are a mountain range on the Olympic Peninsula of
the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The mountains, part of
the Pacific Coast Ranges, are not especially high – Mount Olympus is the
highest summit at 7,980 ft (2,432 m); however, the eastern slopes rise
precipitously out of Puget Sound from sea level, and the western slopes
are separated from the Pacific Ocean by the low-lying 20 to 35 km (12 to
22 mi) wide Pacific Ocean coastal plain. These densely forested western
slopes are the wettest place in the 48 contiguous states. Most of the
mountains are protected within the bounds of Olympic National Park and
adjoining segments of the Olympic National Forest. </p>
<p> The mountains are located in western Washington in the United States,
spread out across four counties: Clallam, Grays
Harbor, Jefferson and Mason. Physiographically, they are a section of the
larger Pacific Border province, which is in turn a part of the
larger Pacific Mountain System. </p>

    <h3>Geography</h3>

<p> The Olympic Mountains in winter, as seen from the east. The Brothers is
the large double peak on the left, and Mount Constance is on the right.
The Olympics have the form of a domed cluster of steep-sided peaks
surrounded by heavily forested foothills and incised by deep valleys. They
are surrounded by water on three sides, separated from the Pacific by the
20 to 35 km (12 to 22 mi) wide coastal plain.[3] The general form of the
range is more or less circular, or somewhat horseshoe-shaped, and the
drainage pattern is radial.[4]</p>

    <h3>Climate</h3>

<p> Precipitation varies greatly throughout the range, from the wet western
slopes to the semi-arid eastern ridges. Mount Olympus, nearly 8,000 feet
(2,400 m) tall, is a mere 35 miles (56 km) from the Pacific Ocean, one of
the steepest reliefs globally and accounting for the high precipitation of
the area, with an estimated 240 inches (6,100 mm) of snow and rain on
Mount Olympus.[10] 140 to 170 inches (3,600 to 4,300 mm) of rain falls on
the Hoh Rainforest annually,[11] receiving the most measured precipitation
of anywhere in the contiguous United States.[12] Areas to the northeast of
the mountains are located in a rain shadow cast by the mountain
themselves, and receive as little as 16 in (410 mm) of precipitation
around the city of Sequim.[13] Annual precipitation increases to about
30 in (760 mm) on the edges of the rain shadow around Port Townsend, the
San Juan Islands, and the city of Everett across Puget Sound.[12] 80% of
precipitation falls during the winter months. On the coastal plain, the
winter temperature stays between −2 and 7 °C (28 and 45 °F). During the
summer it warms up to between 10 and 24 °C (50 and 75 °F),[14] with
occasional hot spell days reaching to the upper 80s to low 90s F (30° -
35° C).</p>
<p> The large number of snowfields and glaciers, reaching down to 1,500 m
(5,000 ft) above sea level, are a consequence of the high precipitation,
northern latitude, and cool moderating climate adjacent to the Pacific
Ocean. There are about 184 glaciers and permanent ice fields crowning the
Olympics peaks.[15] The most prominent glaciers are those on Mount
Olympus covering approximately 10 square miles (26 km2). Beyond the
Olympic complex are the glaciers of Mount Carrie and others in the Bailey
Range, Mount Christie, Mount Queets, and Mount Anderson,[16] however most
of these have experienced significant decrease in both length and mass in
recent decades, with several disappearing completely in the driest
northeastern portion of the mountains.</p>

    <h3>Geology</h3>

<p> The Olympics are made up of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic
crust. They are primarily Eocene sandstones, turbidites,
and basaltic oceanic crust.[17] Unlike the Cascades, the Olympic Mountains
are not volcanic, and contain no native granite. </p>
<p> Millions of years ago, vents and fissures opened under the Pacific Ocean
and lava flowed forth, creating huge underwater volcanic mountains and
ranges called seamounts. The Farallon tectonic plate that formed a part of
the Pacific Ocean floor (separate from the Pacific plate) inched eastward
toward North America about 35 million years ago and most of the sea floor
subducted beneath the continental land mass of the North America plate.
Some of the sea floor, however, was scraped off and jammed against the
mainland, creating the dome that was the forerunner of today's Olympics.
In this particular case, the future Olympics were being jammed into a
corner created by the Vancouver Island and North Cascades microcontinents
attached to the western edge of the North America plate. This is thought
to be the origin of the curved shape of the Olympic Basaltic Horseshoe, an
arc of submarine basalt running east along the Strait of Juan de Fuca,
south along Hood Canal, and then west to Lake Quinault.[4] Thrust-faulting
northeast into the Vancouver Island/North Cascades corner pushes Olympic
rock upward and southwestward, resulting in strata that appear to be
standing on edge and that intermix with strata of different mineral
composition.[10] All this occurred under water; the Olympics began to rise
above the sea only 10–20 million years ago. </p>
<p> The Olympics were shaped in the Pleistocene era by
both alpine and continental glaciers advancing and retreating multiple
times. The valleys of the Hoh, Queets, and Quinault rivers are typical U-
shaped valleys carved by advancing alpine glaciers. Piles of talus and
rockfall were created by retreating alpine glaciers. In the high
mountains, the major rivers have their headwaters in alpine glacially
carved cirques. During the Orting, followed by the Stuck, the Salmon
Springs, and the Fraser glaciations, the vast continental Cordilleran Ice
Sheet descended from Alaska south through British Columbia to the
Olympics.</p>
<p>The ice split into the Juan de Fuca and Puget ice lobes, as
they encountered the resistant Olympic Mountains, carving out the current
waterways and advanced as far south as present day Olympia. Ice flowed up
the river valleys as far as 3,800 feet (1,200 m), carrying
granitic glacial erratics with it.</p>

<h3> Rivers </h3>
<p>Rivers radiate outwards to all sides. Clockwise from windward to leeward,
the major watersheds
are: Satsop, Wynoochee, Humptulips, Quinault, Queets, Hoh, Bogachiel, Sol
Duc (all flowing west into the Pacific Ocean; with the Satsop, Wynoochee
by way of the Chehalis River, the Humptulips by way of Grays Harbor at the
mouth of the Chehalis River, and the Bogachiel and Sol Duc forming
the Quillayute River within 5 miles of
tidewater), Lyre, Elwha, Dungeness (all flowing north into the Strait of
Juan de Fuca), Big Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hamma Hamma,
and Skokomish (all flowing east into Hood Canal). </p>
<h3>Protected areas</h3>
<p>A large portion of the range is contained within the Olympic National
Park. Of this portion, 95% is part of the Daniel J. Evans
Wilderness.[6][7]
The national park is surrounded on the south, east, and northwest sides by
the Olympic National Forest, with five wilderness areas,[8] and on the
southwest side by the Clearwater State Forest with one Natural Area
Preserve (Washington Department of Natural Resources), and the Quinault
Indian Reservation.[9] State parks and wildlife areas occur in the lower
elevations.</p>
