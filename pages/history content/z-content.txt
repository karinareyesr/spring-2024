“The Internet as we know it really got started in the early 1960s. That was when J.C.R. Licklider — a computer scientist with technology company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) — formulated a few unique ideas about global networking in a series of memos, describing an "Intergalactic Computer Network."
His idea: link computers together across the globe; and anybody near a computer could share information. As it turns out, Licklider had the right idea at the right time. The Cold War had the United States searching for a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack.” 

Tim Berners-Lee developed the first HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in 1989
(Published text has always been marked up so that the author and publisher would be able to synchronize and layout a publication the way it has been envisioned. TBL created a markup language that tells a web browser how to visually display a page the way the “author” envisioned it.) 

Marc Andereessen added an image tag to HTML and founded Netscape - 1993

During the 90’s there were browser wars and HTML was becoming fragmented. TBL created w3c. (https://www.w3.org/) to maintain HTML standards.

There have been many versions of HTML. We are currently in version HTML5 and many people don’t see a sixth one coming any time soon, if ever.
